        "description": "A Greater Pearl River Delta Cultural Cooperation Project\n\n\nThe Drunken Wu Song Beats Jiang Zhong (Guangzhou)\n\nWu Song is exiled to a prison camp in Mengzhou. There he befriends Shi En, the warden's son, who admires his bravery. When Shi En's tavern is seized by the local bully Jiang Zhong, Wu Song is filled with fury and spurred on by the wine he drinks, he storms to the tavern at Happy Forest and soundly beats up Jiang.\n\nWu Song: Su Guojin  Jiang Zhong: Mai Shaocong\n\n \n\nThe Forced Divorce Letter from The Reunion by a White Hare (Hong Kong)\n\nThe Reunion by a White Hare begins with Li Sanniang's fateful meeting with the impoverished Liu Zhiyuan — her embroidered handkerchief is blown into a stable, where it lands on Liu, and in pursuit, she meets him and falls in love at first sight. Despite her brother and sister-in-law's slander, Sanniang's parents take pity on Zhiyuan's plight and accept him as their son-in-law. Later, Sanniang's parents have passed away and her elder brother, Hongyi, urged by his wife, tries to seize the family estate and forces his brother-in-law Zhiyuan into a divorce. Sanniang refuses to yield, and the family divides in bitterness.\n\nLiu Zhiyuan: Chin Shan  Li Sanniang: Sum Yung  Li Hongxin: Wan Yiu-sing \n\nLi Hongyi's wife: Chow Lok-tung  Li Hongyi: Ng Lap-hei\n\n \n\nThe Triumphant Return and the Reunion from The Reunion by a White Hare (Hong Kong)\n\nEight years later, Zhiyuan has been knighted by the emperor for his military feats. He and his son Yaoqilang return to their native place. While out hunting one day, the boy chases a white hare and meets a woman by a well, who is none other than his birth mother, Li Sanniang. Though unaware of their true bond, he learns of her sufferings and promises to help. When Zhiyuan hears his son's account, he rushes to find his long-lost wife. With the help of the Fire God, the couple are joyfully reunited. The greedy elder brother and wife, on seeing their change of fortune, attempt to curry favour but are sternly rebuked. Mother and son at last recognise each other, and the family is happily reunited.\n\nLiu Zhiyuan: Vong Seng-pan  Li Sanniang: Ng Man-ting  Li Hongxin: Wan Yiu-sing \n\nLi Hongyi's wife: Chow Lok-tung  Li Hongyi: Ng Lap-hei \n\nFire God: Cheung Siu-lun  Yaoqilang: Ng Sin-hang  Yue Xiuying: Wong On-ching\n\n \n\nPicking Cherries (Guangzhou)\n\nThe daughter of an esquire goes to the garden with her maid Yun'er to admire the flourishing spring scene. On seeing the ripe cherries on the branches, the maid exerts herself to pluck them down for her mistress.\n\nYun'er: Li Yuqi  Miss Mu: Wu Sihua\n\n \n\nReunion in the Nunnery from Princess Changping (Macao)\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming regime, Princess Changping hides her identity in a Taoist nunnery to escape the Qing pursuers. When her former consort, Zhou Shixian, happens to come by one day and recognises her, she refuses admit and accepts him.\n\nZhou Shixian: Ruan Dewen  Princess Changping: Cheong Sut-ian\n\n \n\nWandering in the Garden and The Interrupted Dream (Macao)\n\nDu Liniang is the sheltered daughter of Prefect Du Bao. One spring day, she takes a stroll in her family garden with her maid Chunxiang. Moved by the beauty of the scene, she feels a yearning for love. She takes a short nap and has an amorous dream with a young scholar. It is so vivid that even when she wakes up, she is filled with longing.\n\nLiu Mengmei: Kong Io-hei  Du Liniang: Chang Hoi-ieng\n\n \n\nThe Gift of a Pearl on Rainbow Bridge (Guangzhou)\n\nThe Water Fairy Lingbo secretly falls in love with a mortal man named Bai Yong. They meet in the Crystal Palace on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and she gifts Bai a precious pearl as a token of love. When the Jade Emperor learns of this, he sends God Erlang and heavenly soldiers to capture her. After a fierce battle, Lingbo repels the celestial troops, and the couple joyfully reunite.\n\nThe Water Fairy Lingbo: Gong Jieying  Young Master Bai Yong: Xian Jiantang\n\n \n\nArtistic Directors: Lung Koon Tin, Sun Kim Long, Chan Hung-chun (Hong Kong)\n\nPercussion Leaders: Yau Lung (Hong Kong), Huang Zixian (Guangdong & Macao)\n\nMusic Leaders: Pang Kam-shun (Hong Kong), Zhu Weiping (Guangdong & Macao)",
